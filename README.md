# genai-project-demo

Welcome to **genai-project-demo**—my play-by-play journal of a 10-hour hackathon where I led two teammates in building a end-to-end GenAI prototype. Inside you’ll find:

- **Decision Diary**: Notes on every key choice, from prompt design to database selection.  
- **Core Prototypes**: The lean code we wrote to wire up GPT, handle edge cases, and show results.  
- **Team Playbook**: How I broke tasks into bite-sized chunks, onboarded teammates, and kept us on schedule.  
- **Post-Sprint Learnings**: What went well, what tripped us up, and ideas for next time.
